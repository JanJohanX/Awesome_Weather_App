# Awesome Weather App

## Hello World!

This is my personal project, [weather app](https://frosty-wiles-253d3b.netlify.com/).

This project I designed in [Figma](https://www.figma.com).

Each weather picture I draw in [AffinityDesigner](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) on iPad 2018;

For weather data I use [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/).

And it is build in [Vue](https://cli.vuejs.org/).

## I hope you will like this Awesome Weather App !
